            <p>
                A Residential Boundary Survey is used to identify a residential property’s boundary lines.
                In this type of survey, our certified, licensed professional surveyors will set (or recover) the property corners and produce a detailed plat or map. 
                To accomplish this, the surveyor will research the public records and do research in the field, take measurements, and perform calculations.

            <p>
                A topographic survey locates all surface features of a property, and depicts all natural features and elevations. 
                In essence it is a 3-dimensional map of a 3-dimensional property showing all natural and man-made features and improvements. 
                Specifically, it shows their location, size, height and any changes in elevation.

            <p> 
                Metes and bounds are the limits or boundaries of a piece of property as identified by its natural landmarks. 
                Examples of metes and bounds landmarks include rivers, roads, stakes, or other such natural or manmade markers.

            <p>
                An ALTA/NSPS (formerly ALTA/ACSM) Land Title Survey is a complex survey product designed to assist all parties involved in a commercial real estate transaction.
                Whether being used by the title insurer to delete or determine exceptions, or by the buyer and seller to assess potential risk, it is a comprehensive product that allows for a detailed view of an existing property.

                An ALTA/NSPS survey is based upon very specific survey standards with requirements put into place by the American Land Title Association (ALTA) and the National Society for Professional Surveyors (NSPS). 
                These survey requirements and standards must be accepted and followed.  
            </p>

                An Elevation Certificate contains pertinent elevations relative to the base flood elevation and is used for the application of flood insurance. 
                The form also indicates the elevation of the building and the lowest adjacent grade next to the building.
                If the Lowest Adjacent Grade is higher or at the same elevation as the Base Flood Elevation the structure is eligible for removal from the flood zone.
